## How it works

WATpixels generates a VGA display output at 640×480 resolution with 60Hz refresh rate. The design combines animated pattern layers (checkerboard and gradient patterns) with a Waterloo Engineering emblem overlay. A speed controller allows adjusting animation speed, and pause/resume controls are available.

## How to test

Connect to a VGA display using the output pins (hsync, vsync, and RGB signals). The module runs at 25.2 MHz and automatically generates the display patterns. Use input pins to control speed and pause/resume functionality.
